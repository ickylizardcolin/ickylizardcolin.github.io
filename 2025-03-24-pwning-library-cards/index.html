<p>I scanned the barcode using <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.markusfisch.android.binaryeye/" title="Install me!">Binary Eye (fdroid)</a> (best scanner.) It was a 16-character CODABAR barcode mesasuring just under 2in/5cm wide and 1/4in/1cm long.</p>

<p>The First and last bytes were “A”, with 14 ASCII-encoded numbers between them. I replicated the bar code, printed it off, and got into my account.</p>
